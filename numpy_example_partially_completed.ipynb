To make it invertable, we need to apply the displacement boundary condition. For this problem, the displacement boundary condition is $\\delta_1=0$. To applying this boundary condition, we'll change the first row of the matrix equation to $\\delta_1=0$. After apply this boundary condition, the K matrix will become invertable.\n"
